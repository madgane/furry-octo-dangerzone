This section deals with the user selection for co-ordinate transmission. In co-ordinate transmission, users in the system \me{\mc{U}} can be served by any BS from the set \me{\mc{B}} without any restriction over the user search as discussed in section \ref{sus}. The selection of users for \me{\mc{S}_k \fall k \inm \mc{B}} is performed by considering the complete user set and the global transmission user set \me{\mc{S}^i_\cup} at each iteration. The spatial freedom is shared between the desired and interfering users to achieve interference free transmission between the users served by BSs in \me{\mc{B}} by providing equal share \me{\left \lfloor \frac{N_\mrm{T}}{N_\mrm{B}} \right \rfloor}.

Following the same assumptions as in section \ref{sus}, co-ordinate scheduling is performed by selecting users for each BS in a sequential manner and iterated over the complete set of BSs. The transmission user sets \me{\mc{S}_k \fall k \inm \mc{B}} and \me{\mc{S}_\cup} are initialized with \me{\emptyset}. The selection is performed over each BS \me{k} over the user set \me{\mc{U}} until the transmission user set equals \me{\card{\mc{S}_k} = \left \lfloor \frac{N_\mrm{T}}{N_\mrm{B}} \right \rfloor}. The users are selected by the determinant criterion which ensures the selected users are not in the same subspace. The metric is calculated by taking the determinant of




%This section discusses the user selection strategy performed over the set \me{\mc{U}_b \sset \mc{U}} which represents the users linked to BS \me{b}. The selection performed over the associated user set \me{\mc{U}_b, \fall b \inm \mc{B}} provides the transmission set \me{\mc{S}_b} of BS \me{b} which needs to be signalled to all BSs in the set \me{\{ \mc{B} \bs b \}}. The selection is carried out in an iterative manner with the limited signaling between the cooperating BSs to maximize the overall sum throughput.
%
%In multi-BS scenario, the available spatial dimension \me{N_\mrm{T}} is shared between the transmission of information to the desired cell users and minimizing the interference created to the neighboring cells. This is performed by sharing the available spatial freedom \me{N_\mrm{T}} over the cooperating BSs in \me{\mc{B}} by dividing the spatial dimension over \me{\card{\mc{B}}} as given by \me{\left \lfloor \frac{N_\mrm{T}}{N_\mrm{B}} \right \rfloor} with the assumption \me{N_\mrm{T} \geq N_\mrm{B}}. In order to discuss the scheme, let \me{\mc{S}^{i}_{\cup} = \{ \mc{S}_1 \cup \mc{S}_2 \cup \dotso \cup \mc{S}_{N_\mrm{B}} \}} represents the transmission user set of the network at \me{i^\mrm{th}} iteration, \me{\mc{S}^i_{\cup,b} = \{ \mc{S}^i_{\cup} \bs \mc{S}_b \} } represents the transmission user set excluding BS \me{b}, and \me{\mbf{A}^{\perp}} represents the null space of the matrix \me{\mbf{A}}.
%
%To begin with, initialize \me{\mc{S}_j \fall j \inm \mc{B}} and \me{\mc{S}^i_{\cup}} to \me{\emptyset} at \me{i = 0}. Let us consider \me{\mc{B}_k} selects the transmission user set \me{\mc{S}_k} from \me{\mc{U}_k} based on QR based selection discussed in \cite{zhang2007user,sun2009eigenmode} or single BS user selection as discussed in Sect. \ref{sbus}. This information is used while selecting \me{\{\, \mc{S}_j \fall j \inm \mc{B} \bs k \, \}} in order to provide efficient transmission set \me{\mc{S}^i_{\cup}} at \me{i = 1} iteration instant. The sets in \me{\{\, \mc{S}_j \fall j \inm \mc{B} \bs k \, \}} is updated by selecting the users from the corresponding user set \me{\mc{U}_j} by the following metric
%\begin{eqnarray}
%\begin{array}{lll}
%\mbf{T}_{jj} &=& \left [ \; \mvecxyz{h}{j}{x} \; \right ], \, \fall x \inm \mc{S}_{j} \\
%\mbf{T}_j &=& \left [ \; \mvecxyz{h}{j}{l} \; \right ], \, \fall l \inm \mc{S}^i_{\cup,j} \\
%\mbf{T}_{j,m} &=& \left [ \; \mbf{T}_j \quad \mbf{T}_{jj} \quad \mvecxyz{h}{j}{m} \; \right ], \, m \inm \mc{U}_j \\
%d_m &=& \det{ \left ( \; \mbf{T}^\mrm{H}_{j,m} \, \mbf{T}_{j,m} \; \right ) }
%\end{array}
%\label{sus-iter0}
%\end{eqnarray}
%where \me{\mbf{T}_j} matrix has the channel between BS \me{j} to the neighboring users in \me{\mc{S}^1_{
%\cup},j}, \me{\mbf{T}_{jj}} is the matrix with channel vectors of all the users already selected in BS \me{j}, and \me{d_m} represent the metric of \me{m^{\mrm{th}}} user in \me{\mc{U}_j}. The user set \me{\mc{S}_j} is updated with the user having maximum metric \me{u = \argmax_m \, d_m} as \me{\mc{S}_j = \{ \mc{S}_j \cup u\}} and \me{\mc{S}^i_{\cup}} is also updated with \me{\{\mc{S}^i_{\cup} \cup \mc{S}_j \}} once \me{\card{\mc{S}_j} = \left \lfloor \frac{N_\mrm{T}}{N_\mrm{B}} \right \rfloor} is achieved. This process is performed over all BSs in a sequential manner to complete one iteration. The second and further iterations are carried out for each BS \me{k} by setting \me{\mc{S}_k = \emptyset} and the new set of transmission user set \me{\mc{S}_k} is updated by using \eqref{sus-iter0}. The iterations are carried out till \me{\mc{S}^{i - 1}_{\cup} = \mc{S}^i_{\cup}} is achieved. The convergence is guaranteed since the search is over the closet set of channel vectors. The Algorithm \ref{sus-a1} describes the procedure of user selection for multi-BS in an iterative manner.
