The existing work on user scheduling for MU-MIMO based transmissions were based on QR based scheme which provides capacity maximizing transmission user set in tandem with the linear precoder designs based on ZF. The complexity involved with such schemes are significantly high owing to the matrix inverses and null-space estimation. This paper addressed the scheduling schemes which provides better performance over existing QR based schemes and addressed the complexity reduction aspect as well. The queue based scheduling for MU-MIMO provides fair selection to minimize the overall backlogged packets in the system with users of different arrival rates governed by the Poisson process. The later part of the paper discussed the multi-BS user scheduling to achieve similar performance using coordinated ZF with the highly complex WMMSE based joint user and precoder design. The future work is to provide scheduling based on the delay constrained traffic models which has practical significance in the IP based architecture used in the current standards.
