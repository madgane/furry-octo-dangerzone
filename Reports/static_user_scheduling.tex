This section discusses the user selection strategy in which the users are selected from the set \me{\mc{U}_b \sset \mc{U}} representing users linked to the BS \me{b}. The selection performed over the associated user set \me{\mc{U}_b, \fall b \inm \mc{B}} provides the transmission set \me{\mc{S}_b} of BS \me{b} which needs to be signalled to all BSs in the set \me{\{ \mc{B} \bs b \}}. The selection is carried out in an iterative manner with the limited signaling between the cooperating BSs to maximize the overall sum throughput.

In multi-BS scenario, the available spatial dimension \me{N_\mrm{T}} is shared between the transmission of information to the desired cell users and minimizing the interference created to the neighboring cells. This is performed by sharing the available spatial freedom \me{N_\mrm{T}} over the cooperating BSs in \me{\mc{B}} by dividing the spatial dimension over \me{\mc{B}} as given by \me{\left \lfloor \frac{N_\mrm{T}}{N_\mrm{B}} \right \rfloor} with the assumption \me{N_\mrm{T} \geq N_\mrm{B}}. Let \me{\mc{S}_{i,\cup} = \{ \mc{S}_1 \cup \mc{S}_2 \cup \dotso \cup \mc{S}_{N_\mrm{B}} \}} represents the transmission user set of the network at \me{i^\mrm{th}} iteration, \me{\mc{S}^b_{i,\cup} = \{ \mc{S}_{i,\cup} \bs \mc{S}_b \} } represents the transmission user set excluding BS \me{b}, and \me{\mbf{A}^{\perp}} represents the null space of the matrix \me{\mbf{A}}.
