This section deals with the selection of users for transmission set \me{\mc{S}_b} from the users associated with BS \me{b} denoted by \me{\mc{U}_b}. The scheduling is performed by exchanging the user indices in \me{\mc{S}_b \fall b \inm \{1,2,\dotsc,\mscrmxy{N}{B} \} } across each BSs in a distributive manner with limited information exchange. This scheme is carried out in an iterative manner until the set \me{\mc{S}_b \fall b} is converged. 

The spatial freedom of \me{\mscrmxy{N}{T}} antennas cannot be used completely for multiplexing when the users are at cell-edge. This limitation arises based on diversity-multiplexing tradeoff (DMT) which is briefed in \cite{tse2005fundamentals}.
